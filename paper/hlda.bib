abstract = {Objects in the world can be arranged into a hierarchy based on their semantic meaning (e.g. organism – animal – feline – cat). What about defining a hierarchy based on the visual appearance of objects? This paper investigates ways to automatically discover a hierarchical structure for the visual world from a collection of unlabeled images. Pre-vious approaches for unsupervised object and scene discov-ery focused on partitioning the visual data into a set of non-overlapping classes of equal granularity. In this work, we propose to group visual objects using a multi-layer hierar-chy tree that is based on common visual elements. This is achieved by adapting to the visual domain the generative Hierarchical Latent Dirichlet Allocation (hLDA) model pre-viously used for unsupervised discovery of topic hierarchies in text. Images are modeled using quantized local image re-gions as analogues to words in text. Employing the multi-ple segmentation framework of Russell et al. [22], we show that meaningful object hierarchies, together with object seg-mentations, can be automatically learned from unlabeled and unsegmented image collections without supervision. We demonstrate improved object classification and localization performance using hLDA over the previous non-hierarchical method on the MSRC dataset [33].},

abstract = {We present the nested Chinese restaurant process (nCRP), a stochastic process that assigns probability distributions to ensembles of inÞnitely deep, inÞnitely branching trees. We show how this stochastic process can be used as a prior distribution in a Bayesian nonparametric model of document collections. SpeciÞcally, we present an application to information retrieval in which documents are modeled as paths down a random tree, and the preferential attachment dynamics of the nCRP leads to clustering of documents according to sharing of topics at multiple levels of abstraction. Given a corpus of documents, a posterior inference algorithm Þnds an approximation to a posterior distribution over trees, topics and allocations of words to levels of the tree. We demonstrate this algorithm on collections of scientiÞc abstracts from several journals. This model exempliÞes a recent trend in statistical machine learning—the use of Bayesian nonparametric methods to infer distributions on {\ss}exible data structures.},
